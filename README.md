What I am aiming with this project is to learn the fundamentals of sending and receiving data using a data base.
In this project I am aiming to create a messaging program which will use Firebase of Google for database.

# To Do List

Give users a way to connect to eachother (check)
Add a database connection (check)
Add a timer to refresh messages (check)

Adjust timer to prevent message lose (nearly check)
Change the location of the timer from Chatpage to Mainpage and rebuild your program around it.
